# Hustle-AI 🧠💸

Autonomous AI system that researches trending affiliate offers, enriches them with GPT-4, and generates all necessary ad creatives — fully automating the income-generation pipeline.

---

## 🔥 What It Does

1. **Scrapes trending affiliate products** from Digistore24.
2. **Analyzes offers using GPT-4** to extract the best angle, platform, and conversion strategy.
3. **Auto-generates**:
   - Sales email copy
   - Ad hook scripts
   - Landing page content

Everything saves into the `generated/` folder for easy publishing.
